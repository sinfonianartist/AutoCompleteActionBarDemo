AutoCompleteActionBar
=====================

AutoCompleteActionBar is an example project designed as a learning and education
tool for the understanding of complex pieces of the ActionBar. This can be used
in Android versions 4.0 and up and currently is not compatible with ActionBarSherlock.

The project will automatically compile when downloaded and can be run instantly 
to see a demo of this working, or you can mess around with the source files and 
see if you can fit it to your needs.
